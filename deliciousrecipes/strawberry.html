                    <li>1 cup (226g) unsalted butter(softened to room temperature)</li>

        </section>

            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy. Add the sugar and beat until very light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Stir together the sour cream and whole milk in a measuring cup and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until fully incorporated before adding the next, scraping down the bowl in between. Beat in the vanilla.</li>
                <li>With the mixer on low speed, gradually add a third of the flour mixture to the butter mixture, followed by half of the sour cream mixture. Repeat, alternating between the flour and sour cream.</li>
                <li>Beat the chopped strawberries into the batter.</li>
                <li>Divide the batter among the cupcake liners. Bake one pan at a time for 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes in the pan, then remove the cupcakes and continue cooling on a wire rack.</li>
                <li>Make the frosting by beating the butter and salt on medium speed until very creamy and pale. With the mixer on low speed, gradually add in the powdered sugar and strawberry puree until fluffy combined before adding the vanilla. Increase speed to medium and beat until fluffy and very spreadable, then transfer to a piping bag. Pipe over the cooled cupcakes.</li>
                <li>Garnish with fresh strawberries, if desired.</li>

            </ol>

            <h2>For Topping</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the butter and salt on medium speed until very creamy and pale, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>With the mixer on low speed, gradually add in the powdered sugar and strawberry puree* until fluffy combined. Stope and scrape down the bowl as needed. Add the vanilla. Increase speed to medium and beat until fluffy and very spreadable, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a decorative tip and pipe the frosting on top of the cooled cupcakes. Garnish with fresh strawberries, if desired. Cupcakes can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature without the garnish for up to 3 days or refrigerated for up to 1 week.</li>
